N2 Machine Simulator - The purpose of this program is to replicate the 32768-byte N2 machine's instructions being printed 
and checked for validity of instructions. Registers are stored and maintained to process instructions. This program also 
checks whether the program is considered safe and follows all input rules.

Multithreaded Line Checker - This is a multithreaded program that opens each file, reads the file by character, determines 
the length of the line, and keeps track of the number of lines in each file that are over 80 characters.

Dynamically Allocated Priority Queue - A priority queue in which each node in the structure is dynamically allocated. The 
priority queue can enqueue, dequeue, and return its data values with zero memory leaks.

Compilation Commands - This file deals with the loading, reading, and executing of compilation and testing commands, 
using forking techniques and a data structure named Commands. The data structure used is a linked list, where each node contains a 
command. Zero memory leaks occur in this project.

Assembly Code - This project is a conversion of code from C to MIPS assembly code.
